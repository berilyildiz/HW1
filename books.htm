	<p> My favourite book is 'Daha'. The writer of this book is Hakan GÃ¼nday. Also he is one of my favourite writers.<br>
	As you read this sentence, somewhere in the country, people are preparing to embark on an endless journey to escape from war,<br>
	hunger and poverty. But this story is not about illegal immigrants, but about one of those who kidnapped them. His name is Gaza.<br>
	His father is a human trafficker, Gaza at his apprentice. He's only 9. I mean, he's old enough to learn all about life and human, whatever he shouldn't. </p>
